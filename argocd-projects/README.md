## ArgoCD Project Manifests
Contains the appproj manifests for argocd to declaratively deploy new projects, following this convention:
* https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/
* https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/


### Setup
1. adjust the values.yaml to suit the cluster, repo, ect
2. change directory to where README.md is.
3. generate the `argocd-projects.yaml` to use when creating the base app
``` shell
make base
```
4. copy contents of `./base/argocd-projects.yaml` and create a new argocd application with that spec. For example it can be directly copy, pasted, applied in the ui.
5. sync the argocd-projects app and consider autosync.
6. add more applications (projects) under the `./projects/templates` folder.
7. repeat 5-7

* **Note: for security purposes, consider revoking access to the `values.yaml:base.project` argocd project for everyone (such as developers) except infrastructure to reduce exposure in the case where someone accidentally deletes the app of appprojects. Deleting the app of appprojects with cascade enabled will remove all argocd projects resources, which could result in a wide outage, however, typically this would cause all applications using any appproject here to have an `unknown` state.**

### Appproject Full Example
These reside in `./projects/templates/<project_name>`
* use the templates already in there and add in any additional `spec:` details for that particular appproject.
* this full example shows all the various configurations that can be applied.
